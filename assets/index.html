            <p>Steven Paul Jobs (/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate,
                industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO),
                and co-founder of Apple Inc.; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt
                Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and
                CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
                1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>

            <p class="differentText"><i>Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was
                    raised in the San
                    Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and
                    traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism</i></p>

            <p>Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo
                gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
                microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and
                had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
                1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The
                Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter,
                the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long
                power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. </p>
